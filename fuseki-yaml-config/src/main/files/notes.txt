Objective: Configue an Apache Jena Fuseki server

Cover the cases for Smart Cache Graph.
* Datasets TIM (in-memory), TDB2, RDF-ABAC


Process

1 :: Parse the YAML to produce a java datastructure (see Sketch.java)

This data structure is designed to have the elements needed for configuring Fuseki.

YAML can parse to files and directly produce the required classes.

See https://www.baeldung.com/java-snake-yaml
Try section 4.2 using the "!!" declaration in the YAML file but the goal is section 4.4
(no inline class declartions)

Using yamlconfig may not work - too new to Java.
It might need to be normal Java classes ("POJO" = "Plain Old Java Class") which
are classes with getters for each field. The class constructor is settings. Add
"hashCode" and "equals" functions - get the IDE to generate these for you.

If SnakeYAML does not work for this, there is an alternative to SnakeYAML
"jackson" system which does data binding.
https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-yaml

2 :: Do further checking on the data structure.

Add a phase of logical checking - for example are values strings where expected
to be strings? Do all the services have a database (may already be done by YAML
data binding)? Does the database exist in the dadabases object?

Test cases.

Aside (( YAML schema?
  TAke a look at YAML schema.
  https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.3/schemas/yaml_schema.html
  an extensions of JSON schema
  Does it add anyting? Is enough to make it worth it?
))

3 :: Generate RDF. Use the java datastructure to create triples corresponding 
to the TTL configuration. Send these triple to a StreamRDF.

Two kinds of Stream RDF: 
A:: an RDF graph, then write the graph
B:: Use WriterStreamRDFBlocks

See example.ttl for RDF output from eaxmple.yaml.
NB Not checked.
NB example.ttl has some extra details noted in the file.
